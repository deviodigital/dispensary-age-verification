== Description ==

### Age Verification
Add a pop-up window to your website and verify the age of the visitor before allowing them to view your content.

Customize a variety of features in the age verification box.

* Logo image
* Title text
* Message text
* Minimum age

You can do this by going to `Appearance -> Customize -> Age Verification` in your WordPress dashboard.

This plugin is an official add-on for [WP Dispensary](https://www.wpdispensary.com), but **does not** require WP Dispensary to be install in order for it to work.
